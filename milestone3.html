        <h1>Milestone 3 </h1>
      </header>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>In order to learn more about the <strong>strengths</strong> and <strong>weaknesses</strong> of our initial design, we deployed a series of <strong>user enactments</strong>.
      </p>

    <div class="container section">
      <header class="sectiontitle">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
      </header>
      <p>This Milestone document covers the User Enactment study we performed to further refine our design concept.  User enactments provided our team with a powerful view of user needs and motivations via the user of props and scenarios that approximated real-life scenarios.  After conducting our enactment study, we analyzed the results, performed a new cycle of ideation, and refined our concept into the final system and demo design configurations.
      </p>
      <h2>Milestone 2 Recap</h2>
      <p>
        In Milestone 2, we developed and deployed a formative study to better understand our target audience: college students needing assistance with maintaining a healthy lifestyle through exercise.  We developed 5 overall research questions to help us gain a better understanding of this target audience, they were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>RQ 1:  What motivates the Target Audience to exercise?</li>
        <li>RQ2:  What factors prevent target from exercising?</li>
        <li>RQ3:  How does Target Audience learn how to exercise?</li>
        <li>RQ4:  What kind of exercises does our Target audience actually do?</li>
        <li>RQ5:  What resources does our Target Audience use to enable their exercise?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To help us better explore our research questions, we chose two specific research methodologies: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A diary study where users would fill out what physical activities they did or did not do throughout the course of a week. 
        </li>
        <li>An in-depth survey that which was sent out to thousands of college students to learn more about what exercises they perform, how they learned to perform them, and what resources and tools they use to help enable exercise.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Each methodology was chosen specifically to help answer the research questions that we developed, with the diary study aimed at answering research questions 1 & 2, and the survey aimed at answering questions 3, 4, & 5. 
      </p>
      <p>Using the two different research methods and the data we collected with each, we narrowed down our findings into three critical factors. Those factors were: time management/convenience, cardiovascular and strength training, and providing guidance on how to do exercises correctly. These factors were chosen specifically because of high response rates and consistency shown throughout both studies that each of these factors were important to our target audience. 
      </p>
      <p>With these factors narrow down, we began and ideation session where we each created brand new concepts based solely around the research and the data we collected in Milestone Two. We then took all of the concepts we created (around 20) and narrowed it down to three choices which best represents the data we had collected from our research.
      </p>
      <h2>Concept 1: Life as a Gym AR Glasses</h2>
      <p>A set of smart AR glasses which we have called Life Is A Gym (LG) which are specifically geared towards the time management aspect of our research findings. When worn, these glasses integrate themselves into your everyday life and routines and help identify various exercise opportunities for the user as they go about their day. For example, if a user is walking home from class, the glasses will be able to find a route that takes them home, and while they are walking on that route, the glasses will point out various objects in the environment that the user can use to sneak in a quick workout or just help them get some more physical activity. These glasses were designed specifically to cater towards the “time management” aspect of our milestone 2 findings by helping users get in exercise without having to devote a large chunk of time of their day to go to the gym. 
      </p>
      <h2>Concept 2: Smart Exercise Mat</h2>
      <p>The second concept we created was a smart yoga mat which is geared at providing guidance to our users while they perform their exercises. the smart yoga mat would feature LED panels as well as a large screen interface that can help direct users on how to perform specific exercises, for example, if a user wants to learn how to do proper push-ups a short video will appear on the screen and the exercise mat will light up specific areas for the user to place their hands and feet so they have correct form during the exercise.
      </p>
      <h2>Concept 3: Exercise Gesture guide</h2>
      <p>The final concept was a smart exercise gesture guide. This device would be a touch screen with a camera integrated into it that a user can place in front of them while performing a workout or an exercise. The guide will constantly monitor the user's movements and will be able to show the correct form based on the exercise that is being done. 
      </p>
      <p>These three concepts and the research that we gathered were the main activities that were part of Milestone Two, and now Milestone 3 picks up where they left off. 
      </p>
      <h2>Milestone 3 Concept Narrowing</h2>
      <p>After developing our three concepts in Milestone two, we needed to choose a specific direction to follow for the remainder of the class and our studies. We decided to look again at the data we collected for Milestone 2 and from that data it was apparent that time management was by far the largest issue that our participants addressed during our previous studies. With this in mind we decided to pursue the solution that most closely aligned with our findings and decided to work on our “Life as a Gym” Augmented Reality (AR) glasses.
